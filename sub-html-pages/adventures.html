            <p>Animal behavior - Gorillas are non territorial animals but do live in groups of either one to four male gorillas, some young gorillas, and many adult females gorillas. The male gorillas are called silverbacks and are aggressive because they have responsibility to protect their group. Female gorillas like to compete to groom and stay close to a silverback and are close to their offspring for the first three years. </p>
